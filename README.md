# About me 
Greetings, dear internauts,  
I am Rui Viveiros(irl) but you can call me AlanBitts.

I had several non tech jobs before getting here, such as: bartender, hotel recepcionist, IT technician, communication assistant and convinience store operator (not _smooth operator_, unfortunately)
All those jobs made me realise that I do not want to do repetitive tasks for the rest of my life... I want to build/automate things! I want to contribute for a better Internet! I want help people/businesses grow online!

So that's why in 2024 I decided further pursue knowledge in web development after taking a course on _HTML/CSS/JavaScript_.  

- I‚Äôm currently learning full-stack development (2024-present)
- Undergraduate degree in Communications, Culture and Organizations by [UMa](https://www.uma.pt/en/) (2015)
