# About me 


:wave: Hi, I'm Rui Viveiros aka AlanBitts


IT technician and former communication assistant. I had several non tech jobs before I started my journey here on Github.
In 2024 I decided to go back and persue knowledge in Computer Sciences after taking a course on _Git and Github essentials_.


- 🌱 I’m currently learning full-stack development
- 👨‍🎓 Undergraduate degree in Communications, Culture and Organizations by [UMa](https://www.uma.pt/en/)
- 📚 I love metaphysics, philosophy and classic literature
- ⚡ Fun fact: I love Music, playing instruments, video games and drinking coffe (I must!)
- 🗺️ Based in Island of Madeira
