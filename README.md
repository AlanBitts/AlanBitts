# About me 


:wave: Hi, I'm Rui Viveiros


IT technician and former communication assistant. I had several non tech jobs before starting my journey in coding/programing.
In 2024 I decided further pursue knowledge in web development after taking a course on _Git and Github essentials_.


- 🌱 I’m currently learning full-stack development
- 👨‍🎓 Undergraduate degree in Communications, Culture and Organizations by [UMa](https://www.uma.pt/en/) (2015)
- 💻 IT professional (2012)

📍🌍 Based in Island of Madeira


### Hobbies 
- 📚 I like reading about metaphysics, philosophy, classic literature and sci-fi
- 🎸 I love Music and know how to play guitar and bass. Also know a little bit about music production (I have two original songs that I made during the 2019 pandemic (check my [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@alanbitts))
- 📷 Soon I'll publish a photography portfolio
