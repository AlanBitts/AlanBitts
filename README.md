# About me

I'm Alan, an IT technician and former communication assistant. I had several non tech jobs before I started my journey here on Github but decided to go back and persue knowledge in Computer Sciences in 2024 after taking a course on _Git and Github essentials_.


- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning full-stack development
- âš¡ Fun fact: I love Music, playing instruments, video games and drinking coffe (I must!)
- ðŸ“š I love metaphysics, philosophy and classic literature
